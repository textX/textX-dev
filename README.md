# textX dev extensions

This project contains a set of extension to
[textX](https://github.com/textX/textX) used during development of languages and
generators.

Current extensions:

- `startproject` -- a textX subcommand for project scaffolding. It will ask
  several questions on the terminal and generate textX project based on the
  answers. Questionnaire specification and interpretation is based on
  [textx-lang-questionnaire](https://github.com/textX/textx-lang-questionnaire)
  language.
